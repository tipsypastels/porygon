  changelog:
    19:
      changes:
        - 'Deleted message events are now stored in the database rather than in memory.'
    18:
      changes:
        - "Moved and merged some redundant packages."
        - "Added the `fc` package with `%{pre}fc`, `%{pre}setfc` and `%{pre}delfc`."
    17:
      changes:
        - "Startup is now faster as Porygon uses several techniques to skip as much rebuilding of the join time cache as possible."
        - "Porygon now waits for audit logs for longer and retries several times."
        - "`%{pre}commands` now excludes channels invisible to the user."
    16:
      desc: 'Version 1.0! 🎊 🥳 🎉'
      changes:
        - "Added the `req_role` package, with `%{pre}rolelist`, `%{pre}addrole` and `%{pre}removerole`."
        - "To accompany that, added `%{pre}makerequestable`, `%{pre}makeunrequestable`, `%{pre}setrolelisturl`, and `%{pre}clearrolelisturl` to the mod package."
        - "Fixed an issue where having a package enabled in too many (but not all) channels could cause the embed to go over the max length listing all of them. As of now, that case will be handled by listing all channels a package is *not* enabled in, as long as it's enabled in more than half and over a certain minimum number."
        - "Porygon's portrait now appears in `%{pre}help` when using it without an argument."
    15:
      desc: 'The pets update!'
      changes:
        - 'Introduced `%{pre}pets`, `%{pre}addpet`, and `%{pre}delpet`.'
    14:
      desc: 'The long-awaited (by me putting it off) package update.'
      changes:
        - 'Packages can now be enabled per-channel.'
        - "`%{pre}commands` now respects the user's permissions."
        - "Added `%{pre}enablePackage`, `%{pre}disablePackage`, and `%{pre}packageList`."
        - "Added superglobal packages, which cannot be enabled or disabled but can only be applied to a subset of members. The current superglobals are `operator`, which contains debugging permissions, and `package`, which contains package management itself and is only usable to server admins."
    13:
      changes:
        - 'Porygon can now log join, leave, message delete, kick, and ban events in the mod log channel if one is set.'
        - 'Added `%{pre}unmute` and `%{pre}setMutedRole`, which were previously omitted.'
    12:
      desc: No new commands! Just lots of backend stuff.
      changes:
        - 'Changed the way commands are registered, now uses a macro instead of searching through the ancestry tree for children of `Commands::Command`.'
        - 'Split permissions into three systems - member permissions, bot permissions, and owner only permissions.'
        - "Removed bot permission error handling, the bot now checks its permissions ahead of time. This enables better errors as it can tell you exactly what permission it's missing instead of a generic message."
        - "`%{pre}help`, `%{pre}commands`, and `%{pre}!` are now usable in DMs."
        - "All commands now show up in `%{pre}commands`, even ones the user does not have permission to use. This will change later once package hiding is introduced."
    11:
      changes:
        - 'Removed, split, and merged some packages.'
        - 'Packages are now derived from the filesystem instead of explicitly defined.'
        - 'Removed some unused error utilities and simplified `TranslatedError`.'
        - 'Shorter syntax for defining command arguments.'
        - "Added back the `%{pre}package` command, but it doesn't do much yet."
        - "Added `%{pre}globalIgnore` and `%{pre}globalUnignore`."
        - "Added `%{pre}botIgnore` and `%{pre}botUnignore`."
    10:
      changes:
        - 'Turned off Discordrb logging.'
        - 'Add logging of command usage and errors.'
        - 'For security, commands now default to disabled in DMs unless explicitly set otherwise.'
        - 'Added Ruby-style setter command syntax, where `%{pre}x = ...` is an alias for `%{pre}setx ...`.'
        - 'Added `%{pre}renameServer` and `%{pre}renameChannel`.'

        - "`%{pre}ping` now uses an embed."
        - "Renamed package `debug` to `meta`."
    2:
      desc: This update includes many minor changes to command semantics.
      changes:
        - "Added `%{pre}help` and `%{pre}commands`."
        - "Pory is back to generating one sentence instead of two. Funnier."
        - "You can put multiple words in command options now by wrapping them in quotes, such as `%{pre}flip -h \"do it\" -t \"don't do it\"`."
        - "`%{pre}calc` is much smarter now, has better error messages and lets you define variables in a block at the beginning `%{pre}calc x = 1, y = 2 || x + y`."
        - "Re-broke `%{pre}dice` working with zero rolls. For now."
